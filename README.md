# Project-1

Project outlines:

1.Traffic Fatalities of Urban Areas
2.Traffic Fatalities of Rural Areas
3.Market launch of Uber and Lyft services
4.Traffic Fatalities of holidays
5.Traffic Fatalities of vehicle types

Stephanie:

Compiled all data related to google search uber services and analyzed trends.

Nicholas:

Compiled all data related to fatalities and crashes in rural and urban areas.

Jonathan:

Compiled all data related to fatalities and crashes in rural and urban areas.

Robert:

Compiled all data related to holiday fatalities.  More specifically, using a line chart to show all holidays and the overall trend as it relates to before ride-share apps were released, and after.  Further individual analysis was done for each individual holiday using scatter plots.

Ruoyu (Roy):

Compiled all data related to vehicle type fatalities and crashes in rural and urban areas.
More specifically, the analysis contains line chart first visualize to determine trend lines.
The correlation is calculated to determine trend coefficient in urban and rural counties.
Finally, a heatmap of correlation matric is ploted.

Ronnie: 
Helped with formatting slides and data analysis.

# Final Data Analysis:

#traffic fatalities
Traffic fatalities in urban areas have decreased in the first few years following the release of rideshare apps.
-Traffic fatalities in the urban counties of Los Angeles and San Diego have seen 12% and 24% decreases when comparing 2008 and 2013. 
-In Orange, the number of fatalities actually increased by 14%, while San Francisco stayed the same.
-Traffic fatalities in rural areas have generally stayed the same, there are small decreases in fatalities between 2008 and 2013, however they all begin to increase again the following years.
    -Butte, Imperial, Placer ↓ (by a very small margin)
-From 2013 to 2016, traffic fatalities begin to increase again by 26% over this time period.

#alc related traffic fatalities, urban
-Los Angeles County saw a decrease in drunk driving fatalities over the first three years after the release of ridesharing apps. After 2016, LA County’s drunk driving fatalities had a 60% increase in fatalities, gradually decreasing over the years.
-San Diego County, after the introduction of ridesharing apps,  had drunk driving fatalities decreased by about 30% during the first year, with those numbers steadily increasing, but still staying below the numbers before ridesharing apps.
-San Francisco County saw a consistent decrease in drunk driving fatalities throughout the years following the release of ridesharing apps, with fatalities only increasing at the end of the timeframe the data encompasses. 
Orange County saw no significant change in numbers when ridesharing apps were introduced.

#alc related traffic fatalities, rural
-Both Butte and Placer County saw a noticeable decrease in drunk driving fatalities during the first year the ridesharing apps were introduced, but the number of fatalities increased over the years.
-Imperial County overall had a decrease in drunk driving fatalities after the introduction of rideshare apps when compared to the pre-rideshare app years.
-Shasta County had an overall increase in drunk driving fatalities over the years after rideshare apps were released.

#google search trends, uber/lyft
-Rural counties (Butte/Placer/Shasta, Imperial) were not early adopters of rideshare services and continue to not be big participants in the service. Research has shown that this may be due to technological infrastructure (with shoddy internet service) and less of a desire to adopt the ride-hailing ways like city slickers do.

-Lyft seems to have higher interest in rural areas (2017-2019) and that is due to their expansion model of reaching out to less denser populations.

-Urban counties (Los Angeles/Orange, San Diego, San Francisco) were participants in the early adoption  of rideshare services as communities embraced rideshare services quickly and easily. Uber was highly successful in LA/Orange County first and a year later Lyft launched successfully in San Diego and San Francisco. 

#holiday fatalities
-After the release of ride-sharing apps, for all holiday fatalities, the data show an overall reduction in average deaths from 189 to 148↓ or 22%↓.
-According to the data, July 4th is the most dangerous holiday for alcohol-related fatalities with an average death toll of 213 before ride-sharing apps and 172↓ after the release of ride-sharing apps.
-Christmas and New Years Day saw the greatest reduction in alcohol-related fatalities with 26%↓ and 27%↓ respectively.

#crashes by vehicle type
-The crash cases reported all vehicle types, while Uber services were comprised of sedan/passenger cars instead of large trucks.
-The amount of crashes involving only passenger cars decreased for urban areas compared with those from rural areas.
-No significant decreasing trend was observed for passenger cars from rural counties.
